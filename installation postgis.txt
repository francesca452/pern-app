1. Download prof official page Postgresql
2. Do a check of possible other version already installed in the personal computer.
If so, to not have conflicts, delete old version with all the folders related.
3. Click on the executive file (the installer)
4. Click "Next", select all components (PostgreSQL Server, pgAdmin, StackBuilder, Command Line Tools) and then "Next".
5. Create the password for Postgres "4rancEsc@!"
6. Use the default port number for Postgres 5432
7. In the page of Stack Builder, after the succesfully installation, chose from the panel the option PostgreSQL
8. From the "Categories", choose:
- Spatial Extensions: PostGIS
- Database Drivers: Npgsql, psqlODBC (64 bit), pgJDBC (why??)
9. Don't close the Stac Builder wizard
10. We have to install all the drivers (previously downloaded executive file)
11. For PostGIS check the option "create spatial databse"
12. Now, in Windows menu search for Postgres
- Stack Builder is for install other extentions for postgres
- pgAdmin allows to manage the database using the browser
- If you see two servers (like PostreSQL 17/18) follow the instructions:
    > Click "Windows+r" and type "services.msc", press Enter
    > Check what version of postgres is running
    > If I only see "postgresql-x64-18", then you can go on pgAdmin
    > Remove the "postgresql17" server
    > To look at the port used for connection, go to "postgreSQL18->properties->connection->port" (5432)
13. Click on Databases in "server->PostgreSQL" and create new database (as "dbs").
The owner "postgres" is the super user. We can create new databse also by SQL syntax (in SQL tab).
Click save. "dbs" databse has default public schema.
14. Click on "dbs" and click on "tools (at the top on the screen)->Query tools".
In the Qeury editor type: 
CREATE EXTENSION postgis 
This will enable the postgis extension. Click the "play" icon (execute).
Now, click on "dbs->resfresh": you will see now some data in the "dbs->schemas->public"'s "Function" and "Table" folders.
15. To do frist request, type in the Query editor: 
SELECT * from spatial_ref_sys
(that's the table in Table folder)

-----
1. Go to Qgis downloader and install the last standalone version (not the tests one)
2. Click "Next" untill final install
(.msi files are Windows installation packages, they have a different icon than .exe files.
This is completely normal and safe for QGIS installer)
3. You can add layers on the option "XYZ Tiles"
4. How to load shape files into postgis. Two ways to do that:
    1. Go to windows application and search for "PostGIS Bundle ..." 
    > Click on the icon and you will see a dialog box
    > "View connection details", insert name of the database user (postgres) with application password
    > Insert the name of the database ("dbs")
    > You'll see in the log windows a messagge of succesfully connection
    > Now, we can click on "Add file" and upload .shp file 
    > Pay attention on SRID (Spatial Reference ID) column, because the enviorment don't recognize by
    default the spatial reference. So you need to enter the SRID manually.
    (for example, for data in geographic coordinate: 4326)
    > Then, you can click "Import"
    2.
